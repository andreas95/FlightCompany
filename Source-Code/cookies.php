<h3 class="h3-text">Strictly Necessary Cookies</h3>
<p class="p-text">
These cookies are necessary for the website to function properly. They enable you to navigate around the site, search for flights and other services, and make bookings.

Without these cookies we could not provide the services that you come to the site for.
</p>
<h3 class="h3-text">Performance Cookies</h3>
<p class="p-text">
These cookies allow us to understand how visitors use our site, so we can measure and improve how the site works. For example they help us to know which pages are the most and least popular. They count things like the number of visitors, how long people spend on the site and how they find it. This lets us know where we are doing well, and where we can improve, as well as making sure the pages load quickly and display properly.

All information these cookies collect is anonymous and not tied to any personal information about you. We use services from Google, Adobe and Marin Software to perform these functions.

<h3 class="h3-text">Cookies</h3>
<p class="p-text">
These cookies are used to enable us to provide enhanced functionality, and more personal information and features. This includes being able to watch YouTube videos, providing information about certain destinations, and also allowing you to share content through social networks.

These services are mostly provided by third parties. If you have an account, or use the services of these parties on other websites, then they may be able to know that you have visited our sites. The use of data collected through cookies by those third parties is subject to their own privacy policies; therefore we identify these cookies by the parties setting them.
</p>
<h3 class="h3-text">Targeting/Advertising Cookies</h3>
<p class="p-text">
These cookies are used to deliver adverts that are relevant to you and your interests. They are also used to limit the number of times you see an advertisement as well as help measure the effectiveness of the advertising campaign.

They are placed by our advertising network partners and help to support our investment in the websites – so we can keep our fares as low as possible. They may also be used to show you relevant advertisements on other websites you visit.

The actual cookies they set can change from one moment to the next – so rather than list them here, we identify the companies themselves.
